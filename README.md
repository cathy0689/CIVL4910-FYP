# CIVL4910-FYP

### Python 3.13.11

### Environment:
I used Anaconda Navigator to set up the environment.

I am not sure which environments are already installed on my computer, so I listed those I believe are necessary.

1. httpx
2. neo4j
3. numpy
4. pandas
5. perplexityai
6. matplotlib
7. scikit-learn
8. transformers

### API:
I use the Perplexity API, but it just support API of Sonar model instead of Claude 4.5.

Register Perplexity using UST email and upgarde it to education version to access the API. 

Both "aaa.py" and "environment_test.env" are test files, download them and try running "aaa.py" your local device.
